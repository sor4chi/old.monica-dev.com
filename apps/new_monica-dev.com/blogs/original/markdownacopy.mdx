## This is a header

This is a paragraph. The graph is an `svg` element. And the [rounded indicator](https://monica-dev.com) itself has offset-path defined with the same path definition that renders the graph stroke. Basically, this property enables moving an element along a given path. For brevity, some details are omitted but here is the general idea:

This is a list

- item 1
- item 2
  - item 2.1
    - item 2.2
- item 3

This is a table

| Header 1 | Header 2 |
| -------- | -------- |
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   |
| Cell 3   | Cell 4   |
